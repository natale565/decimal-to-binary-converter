# Decimal To Binary Converter

# Description

This project is a web-based application that converts a decimal number into its binary equivalent while providing a step-by-step animation of the conversion process. It allows users to input any non-negative decimal number, view the conversion process, and see the resulting binary number.

# Features

- Decimal to Binary Conversion: Converts any non-negative decimal number entered by the user to its binary equivalent.

- Step-by-Step Animation: Visualizes the recursive process of converting a decimal number to binary through a series of animations.

- Real-Time Interaction: Users can input numbers and view the animated conversion process.

- Input Validation: Ensures only non-negative integers are accepted.

# Usage

1. Input a Decimal Number: Enter a non-negative decimal number into the input field.

2. Convert: Click the "Convert" button or press "Enter" to initiate the conversion.

3. View Animation: If the entered number is 5, an animation of the recursive conversion process will play. For other numbers, the binary result is displayed directly.

# Files

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.

- styles.css: The CSS file for styling the application.

- script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the conversion and animation.

# JavaScript Overview

- decimalToBinary(input): A recursive function that converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent.

- createAnimationData(input): Generates the data required for the animation, including the steps of the recursive process.

- showAnimation(steps, binaryResult): Displays the animation of the conversion process using the generated steps.

- checkUserInput(): Validates user input and initiates the conversion process.
